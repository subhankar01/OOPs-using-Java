## q1 : [restaurant.java](https://github.com/subhankar01/OOPs-using-Java/blob/main/restaurant.java)
You have been assigning a task to develop a software to keep track of customer for a restaurant, menu detail of the restaurant. For auditing purpose you also want to keep record of the order history of customer and total sale of the restaurant.

## q2 : [spindle.java](https://github.com/subhankar01/OOPs-using-Java/blob/main/spindle.java)

Design of Spindle Speeds of Machine Tools:

The rotational speed, that is, revolution per minute, of spindles of machine tools such as drilling machines or a lathe is designed in geometric progression. Let us assume S1, is the minimum speed, S2 the maximum speed, and n is the number of speeds. The ratio of any two consecutive speeds is the constant geometric ratio R. Thus the n speeds may be written as:

In program, the user has to enter the values of s1=minspeed, s2=maxspeed, and n. The user may make a mistake while entering the values; for example, user may enter zero or less than zero for s1 or s2 or may enter n=1 or less than one. The program takes care of these by throwing appropriate exception. Since the exception are the programmerâ€™s exception, we define the class MyException that extends the standard exception class and defines the exception.

## q3 : [book_isbn.java](https://github.com/subhankar01/OOPs-using-Java/blob/main/book_isbn.java)

Design a class called ISBN to represent an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN for short.
The ISBN consists of 10 digits divided into 4 parts. For example, the ISBN 0 941831 39 6 represents the
following information:
The first part: The first digit "0" signifies the book is from an English-speaking country.
The second part: "941831" identifies the publisher.
The third part: "39" is the title number for the book.
The fourth part: "6" is a check digit to indicate that the sum of the ISBN digits is 10.
The class should have a constructor and methods to set and get the ISBN as a string.
Design a Book class that represents relevant information about a book, including the book's title, author,
publisher, city and date of publication, and price. The class should also include the field ISBN isbnNum;
where ISBN is the class defined above.
This class should include a constructor and the following methods:
- setBookISBN: to set the ISBN for the book.
- getAuthor: to return the author of the book.
- getBookISBN: to get the ISBN of the book.
- printDetails: to print the information of a book in the following form:
```
Book Title: Object First with Java
Book Author: David j. Barnes and Michael Kolling
Publisher: Prentice Hall
ISBN: 0 941831 39 6
```
