You have been assigning a task to develop a software to keep track of customer for a restaurant, menu detail of the restaurant. For auditing purpose you also want to keep record of the order history of customer and total sale of the restaurant.

## q2 

Design of Spindle Speeds of Machine Tools:

The rotational speed, that is, revolution per minute, of spindles of machine tools such as drilling machines or a lathe is designed in geometric progression. Let us assume S1, is the minimum speed, S2 the maximum speed, and n is the number of speeds. The ratio of any two consecutive speeds is the constant geometric ratio R. Thus the n speeds may be written as:

In program, the user has to enter the values of s1=minspeed, s2=maxspeed, and n. The user may make a mistake while entering the values; for example, user may enter zero or less than zero for s1 or s2 or may enter n=1 or less than one. The program takes care of these by throwing appropriate exception. Since the exception are the programmerâ€™s exception, we define the class MyException that extends the standard exception class and defines the exception.
